Picture-in-Picture video viewing
To maintain track of what you're watching while using other websites or applications, 
Picture-in-Picture (PiP) enables you to watch videos in a floating window that is always on top of other windows.
Picture-in-picture (PiP) shrinks a video into a small player so you can keep watching while using other apps on your device.
